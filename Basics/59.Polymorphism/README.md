## Polymorphism

- Many behaviour
    1. `Compile time Polymorphism(Early Binding)`
        - behaviour defined at compile time
        - ex. Method overloading
    2. `Runtime Polymorphism(Late Binding)` - Dynamic Method Dispatch
        - behaviour defined at run time
        - ex. Method Overriding
