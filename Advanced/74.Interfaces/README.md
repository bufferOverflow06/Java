## Interfaces

- all the methods inside `interfaces` are `public abstract`.
- all the variables inside `interfaces` are `final` and `static`.
- we can create refernces for it.
- A class that implements an interface must define all its methods.

- We can have one class implementing multiple interfaces, but in abstract class we can extend only one class.
- An `interface` extends another `interface`
