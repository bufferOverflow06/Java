## Race Condition

- Mutation -> changing the value of something
- Threads and mutation won't go well
- Thread safe
    - only one thread can access a particular resource

- `join()` -> waits for the threads to complete their task
- `synchronized` keyword for a method
    -> the method will called by only one thread at a time
