## Threads

- `Thread` class
    - `start()` and `run()` method
- Behind the scenes Scheduler

## Thread priority and sleep
- `obj.getPriority()`
- `obj.setPriority()`
- `Thread.sleep(miliseconds)`

## Runnable vs Thread

- extending Thread class can cause limitation for a particular class as java does not support multiple inheritance instead we can implement `Runnable` interface
