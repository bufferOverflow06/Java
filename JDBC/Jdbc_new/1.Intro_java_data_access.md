## Java Database Connectivity

- API for client-side access to a database
- Specifically RDBMS focused

### Universal Data Access

- Swappable
- Standard SQL
- JDBC drivers available
- Can run the same code against two different databases if using ANSI standard SQL

### Basic flow

1. Mount driver
2. Create connection
3. Transaction
4. Execute SQL
    - if in transaction commit transaction or roll it back
5. Close Connection

### Exception Handling

- All JDBC operations throw a SQLException
- Named exception so you have to catch it or throw it
- Standardized SQLState code is available
- ErrorCode is available but is vendor specific in most

## Terminology of JDBC

- `DriverManager` - class that interacts with the driver for creating connections
- `DataSource` - modern class that interacts with the driver
- `Connection` - the class that the developer interacts with that manages the actual communication between the client and the server
    - socket connection on a specific port so that the data sent from client to the server and the data that sent back to me is readable in the stream
- `Statement`
    - The representation SQL to be executed against the database
    - where we store the SQL statement to be executed against that database
- `ResultSet`
    - The response from the database in a logical tabular form
- `PreparedStatement`
    - An extension of Statement that is used for precompiled statements(with inputs)
- `CallableStatement` - An extension of PreparedStatement that references stored procedures in the database(with inputs and outputs)

### Transactions
- When you are executing against a database, you are executing to get a commit transaction.
- `Auto-commit` - a function of a database driver where each statement is immediately readable by all processes once executed in the RDBMS.
- It is a **feature of the database driver** (like JDBC in Java) where **every SQL statement you execute is automatically committed** to the database **right after it runs**.

### ðŸ”¸ Breaking it down:

* When **auto-commit is ON**:

  * Each SQL statement (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) is **automatically committed** as soon as it is executed.
  * This means the change is immediately **permanent and visible to other users/processes** connected to the database.
  * No explicit `COMMIT` statement is needed.
* When **auto-commit is OFF**:

  * You have to manually call `COMMIT` to save changes.
  * Until you commit, changes are only visible to your session and can be rolled back.

### Example (Auto-commit ON):

```sql
-- auto-commit is enabled by default
INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Sujan');
-- This insert is immediately saved and visible to all users
```

### If Auto-commit is OFF:

```sql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES (2, 'John');
-- Not yet committed, not visible to others
-- can still ROLLBACK
COMMIT;
-- Now changes are visible to others
```

---

- `Transaction` - a series of statements that must be executed completely or not at all before any other process can read them.

- `Rollback`
    - A mechanism by which  all statements of a transaction are removed from the database such that they appear to all current and future process as never having occurred.
